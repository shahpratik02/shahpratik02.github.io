              I am a second-year Master's student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning, with a strong focus on building scalable AI systems and exploring reinforcement learning and robotics. My greatest strength is my ability to learn and adapt quickly. I began studying Mechanical Engineering at IIT Bombay, one of India's premier institutions, but through projects, coursework, and robotics, I was drawn to AI—particularly reinforcement learning—and pursued it alongside my main degree. By the end of my undergraduate studies, I achieved Department Rank 5 in Mechanical Engineering and published two A* journal papers in reinforcement learning.

              Most recently, at Nutanix, I developed RANGER, a repository-scale code retrieval agent that combines knowledge graph construction with Monte Carlo Tree Search traversal. This system enables multi-hop reasoning across large codebases, outperformed baseline models on multiple benchmarks, and is currently under provisional patent consideration with a submission to ICLR 2026. At Microsoft, I built and deployed a serverless retrieval-augmented generation pipeline on Azure using GPT-3.5 to generate and translate personalized health tips at scale, reducing production time from two weeks to 30 minutes.

              As a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Tech's PACE initiative, I am building an AI inference server that routes requests through a LiteLLM gateway to vLLM servers scheduled on HPC GPUs via Slurm. At Georgia Tech's STAR Lab under Prof. Harish Ravichandar, I am working on Koopman operator-based visual imitation learning for dexterous manipulation. My interest in robotics began during my undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay, where I was part of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team developing the Matsya series and representing India in the international RoboSub competition.

              Across these experiences, my core strength has been quickly learning and applying new technologies. Outside of work, I am an ambitious and disciplined individual with personal interests in fitness, football, and dance, which help me stay balanced and focused.
